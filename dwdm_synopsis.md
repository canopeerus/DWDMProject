# Introduction

The world has changed drastically over the last half decade with one of the
biggest surges in technology,medicine and other social indexes. With the onset
of the Age of Information we have unrestricted access to mountains of data
from the present and past thanks to the easily accessible public records.
Nations have risen and fallen over the years due to various complex
socio-economic factors. This project is aimed at building a robust model
capable of predicting various projections of countries such as GDP,mortality rates,
average literacy etc.

# Dataset Description

The dataset used will be a large collection of records of multiple countries around
the world such as :

* Country
* Region
* GDP
* Birthrate
* Deathrate
* Population
* Climate
* Area
* Coastline
* Crop
* Agriculture
* Industry
* Service
* Literacy
* Arable land
* Other industry
* Net migration
* Population density

The data has been compiled by the US Government across the period 1970-2017.

# Methodology
For this project we have chosen to employ a Time Series Forecasting Model to
achieve our goal.

A Time Series is a series of data points indexed in time order. Most commonly, a
time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus
it is a sequence of discrete-time data.

Time series analysis involved developing models that best capture or describe an
observed time series in order to understand the underlying causes.

Making predictions about the future is called extrapolation in the classical
statistical handling of time series data. Forecasting involves taking models fit on
historical data and using them to predict future observations.

# Scope of the project
The project goal will be to come up with an application that provides reliably accurate
predictions of various parametric measures of the input time series.
